## Why did you solve the challenges with Edina?

In the past years I've solved the challenges in established languages like Java. This year I decided I wanted to do something different. I've recently
published my own language called Edina and I thought it would be a great test for both myself and the language to solve AoC challenges in it. It is
quite difficult since Edina is completely stack oriented (no variables whatsoever), but that's also the fun part. You need to think outside the box a
bit.
